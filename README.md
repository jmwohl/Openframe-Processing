First version of the extension Openframe-processing.
This extension can use directly processing files pde type. OpenFrame only supports upload a file to the server, so the processing has skit that limit.


This extension still does not work. The Openframe project has to accept a pull request.

The extension uses processing-java, to work with files pde has created a script that is responsible for creating the work environment needed for processin-java.

Thank Jonathan Wohl and Isaac Bertran this amazing project
